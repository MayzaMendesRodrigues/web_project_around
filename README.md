# Tripleten web_project_around

An interactive and responsive web page where users can add, remove, and like photos. The project was inspired by travel experiences across the United States and is designed to adapt seamlessly to various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Semantic structure with accessibility in mind.  
- **CSS**: Responsive layout using media queries and BEM methodology for scalable styling.  
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation for popup interactions and dynamic profile editing.  
- **Git**: Use of branches for version control and organized development workflow.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Layout**  
  Developed based on Figma prototypes, using media queries to ensure adaptability across devices of different sizes.

- **Edit Profile Popup**  
  - Opens when the "Edit" button is clicked.  
  - Closes when the close icon is clicked.  
  - Fields for “Name” and “About Me” are pre-filled with current information.  
  - When clicking “Save”, the profile updates in real time and the popup closes.

- **BEM Methodology**  
  The CSS structure follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for better readability and scalability.

- **Branching with Git**  
  Different branches were used during development to organize and isolate features, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

##  Upcoming Features

- Adding and removing photos from the gallery.  
- Like system for photos.  
- Form validation.  
- Local storage or backend integration.  

## Project Goal

This project aims to strengthen skills in responsive web design, DOM manipulation with JavaScript, and best practices in code organization and version control using Git. It was also an opportunity to work with UI layouts based on real design files from Figma.

## Bootcamp Context

This project is part of a front-end development sprint proposed by the bootcamp, focused on:

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript  
- Responsive design with CSS3 and media queries  
- CSS architecture with BEM  
- Git and GitHub branch management
