An interactive and responsive web page where users can add, remove, and like photos. The project was inspired by travel experiences across the United States and is designed to adapt seamlessly to various devices.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML**: Semantic markup with accessibility considerations
* **CSS**: Responsive layout using media queries and BEM methodology for scalable styling.
* **JavaScript(OOP + API integration)**: <br><br>
*DOM manipulation for popup interactions, dynamic profile editing, and gallery features, following object-oriented principles for better code organization and reusability.*<br><br>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for code organization, scalability, and reusability.<br><br>
API integration for fetching and persisting data (cards, likes, user profile).<br><br>
* **Git/GitHub**: Branching strategy and Conventional Commits.
* **Jest:** Unit testing framework for JS functionality.

##  Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to strengthen skills in:

* **Responsive Web Design**
* **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript**
* **Code Organization and Best Practices**
* **Version Control using Git and Conventional Commits**
* **Testing with Jest**
* **Tooling**:

*.editorconfig*<br>
*Prettier*<br>
*Normalize*<br>
*ESLint*

It was developed based on Figma UI prototypes and real design references.

##  Key Features

* Reusable templates & safe rendering.
* Add, like, delete, and expand photos.
* Responsive layout for all device sizes.
* Edit profile popup with real-time updates.
* BEM CSS methodology.
* Git branching with Conventional Commits.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges of this project was the transition from the functional programming paradigm, with which I am more familiar, to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. Applying concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation was crucial for structuring the code in a more scalable and modular way, especially in managing UI elements and creating pop-ups. Overcoming this learning curve allowed me to write cleaner, more reusable, and easier-to-maintain code, strengthening my understanding of how different paradigms can solve the same problems in more efficient ways
